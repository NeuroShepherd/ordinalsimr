<h1>{ordinalsimr} Shiny Application</h1>
<p>The {ordinalsimr} package is intended to assist applied statisticians
with running simulation studies on ordinal data. This Shiny application
provides a point-and-click approach to setting simulation parameters
including setting the number of iterations, the total sample size, the
group size ratio between group 1 and group 2, and the distribution
probabilities of the ordinal endpoint for each group.</p>
<div id="help-files" class="section level2">
<h2>Help Files</h2>
<p>Three vignettes are included with this package:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><code>ordinalsimr-options</code>: options available in the
<code>ordinalsimr</code> package. This vignette is intended for those
who wish to change the default settings of the Shiny app.</li>
<li><code>coding-simulations</code>: how to code your own simulation
studies using the <code>ordinalsimr</code> package, particularly for
simulation scenarios that are not supported by the Shiny app.</li>
<li><code>ordinalsimr</code>: overview of the <code>ordinalsimr</code>
package itself, including the included tests and the Shiny app. It also
provides some details on how to interact with objects downloaded from
the Shiny application.</li>
</ol>
<p>The package vignettes can be accessed using the following code:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>vignette(&quot;ordinalsimr-options&quot;, package = &quot;ordinalsimr&quot;)
vignette(&quot;coding-simulations&quot;, package = &quot;ordinalsimr&quot;)
vignette(&quot;ordinalsimr&quot;, package = &quot;ordinalsimr&quot;)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="included-tests" class="section level2">
<h2>Included Tests</h2>
<ul>
<li>Wilcoxon Test: <code>stats::wilcox.test()</code></li>
<li>Fisher Test:
<code>stats::fisher.test(simulate.p.value = TRUE)</code></li>
<li>Chi-Squared without Continuity Correction:
<code>stats::chisq.test(correct = FALSE)</code></li>
<li>Chi-Squared with Continuity Correction:
<code>stats::chisq.test(correct = TRUE)</code></li>
<li>Proportional Odds model: <code>rms::lrm()</code></li>
<li>Independence Test:

</ul>

<h2>Pages</h2>
<div id="simulation" class="section level3">
<h3>Simulation</h3>
<p>This page is for parameter entries, and includes a “Run Test” button
to press once all parameters have been determined. Processing is
completed when the p-value tables at the bottom of the page appear.</p>
</div>
<div id="distributions" class="section level3">
<h3>Distributions</h3>
<p>Results of a simulation run can be seen here included a visualization
of the p-value densities by test as well as Power, Type II error, Type I
error, and associated confidence intervals for these values. The CI
percentiles can be adjusted as well as the nominal significance level
.</p>
</div>
<div id="report-downloads" class="section level3">
<h3>Report &amp; Downloads</h3>
<p>The metadata, data, and results of the simulation can be downloaded
here. The metadata includes the parameters used in the simulation, the
data includes the simulated data, and the results include the p-values
and test statistics for each iteration.</p>
<p><strong>Experimental feature: a report can be generated in PDF
format. This feature is still in development.</strong></p>
